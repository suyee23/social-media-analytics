# social-media-analytics

This assignment allows students to learn a simple scripting method to crawl data from Twitter/ Youtube/ Facebook or any other kinds of social media platforms. You are required to create a simple script to collect data. Practice how to use API to collect data from various social media services. A term paper must be produced and this would include relevant graphs and tables and it should not exceed 20 pages. You are required to complete the task in a group of 5-6 max students.

We are required to:
1. Choose 4 tools script to collect data from any social media services
2. Document down the step by step guide in collecting the data
3. Describe the cleaning process by each tool
4. Compare the performance in terms of accuracy and the interface usability of the tools in collecting data.

My group chose to crawl data from Twitter via 3 different programming languages (Java, Python and R) and a web crawler known as Octoparse. In the end, we found that python is the most robust tool in web scraping.
